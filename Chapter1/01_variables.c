#include<stdio.h>  // include is a preprocessor directive that tells the compiler to include the contents of the specified header file. In this case, we are including the standard input/output library, which allows us to use functions like printf.

int main(){
    int a; // Variable declaration
    a = 6; // Variable initialization
    printf("The output of this program is %d", a);
    return 0;
