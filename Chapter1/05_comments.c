#include<stdio.h>  // include is a preprocessor directive that tells the compiler to include the contents of the specified header file. In this case, we are including the standard input/output library, which allows us to use functions like printf.

int main(){
    // I am writing this just for fun. This line doesnt do anything.
    printf("Hello world");
    // Ruturn 0 is returning 0 to the operating system, which indicates that the program has executed successfully. It is a common convention in C programming to return 0 from the main function to indicate that the program has completed without errors.
    return 0; // This is return statement
